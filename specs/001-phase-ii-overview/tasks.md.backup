# Frontend Implementation Tasks: Phase II Overview - Spec-Driven Todo Application

**Feature**: Phase II Overview - Spec-Driven Todo Application
**Branch**: `001-phase-ii-overview`
**Generated**: 2026-01-28
**Input**: spec.md, plan.md, openapi.yaml

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/tasks.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Frontend implementation of the Phase II Spec-Driven Todo Application following constitutional requirements. The system implements a Next.js frontend deployed on Vercel that consumes the backend API contracts exactly as defined. The application enforces JWT-based authentication through frontend components and ensures proper user data isolation through authenticated API calls. All development follows contract-first principles with strict adherence to shared contracts as the single source of truth and Vercel deployment best practices.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Approach

Begin with User Story 1 (Core Todo Management) to deliver the minimum viable product. This includes authentication flow, basic task CRUD operations, and user data isolation. Subsequent stories build upon this foundation.

### Incremental Delivery

Each user story represents a complete, independently testable increment. Complete one story before moving to the next to ensure steady progress and early validation.

## Phase 1: Frontend Project & Component Architecture Setup

**Goal**: Establish Next.js frontend project structure with proper configuration for consuming backend API contracts and component architecture, following Vercel deployment best practices.

**Independent Test**: Developer can run the frontend application locally and see the initial UI.

- [ ] T001 Initialize Next.js project in frontend/ directory with TypeScript support
- [ ] T002 Configure environment variables for backend API endpoints (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL)
- [ ] T003 Set up ESLint and Prettier with appropriate configuration for Next.js
- [ ] T004 Install and configure necessary dependencies (axios for API calls, react-hook-form for forms, etc.)
- [ ] T005 Create Vercel-compatible project structure (app/ directory structure with layout.tsx, page.tsx)
- [ ] T006 Set up basic layout and styling configuration (Tailwind CSS or preferred framework)
- [ ] T007 Create component directory structure (components/ui/, components/forms/, components/layouts/)
- [ ] T008 Set up component export structure (index.tsx files for easy imports)
- [ ] T009 Configure component styling approach (CSS modules, Tailwind classes, etc.)
- [ ] T010 Create base component wrapper with proper TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] T011 Configure next.config.js for Vercel deployment settings

- [ ] T013 Configure API routes directory (app/api/) for potential edge functions

---

## Phase 2: Shared UI Components & Authentication Infrastructure

**Goal**: Implement foundational frontend components and services that support all user stories.

**Independent Test**: Common components render correctly and API service can make authenticated calls.

**Phase 3 tasks MUST NOT begin until Phase 2 authentication infrastructure is complete.**

- [ ] T011 Create API service module to handle authenticated requests to backend contracts
- [ ] T012 Implement JWT token storage and retrieval in browser localStorage/sessionStorage
- [ ] T013 Create authentication context/hook for managing user session state

- [ ] T015 Implement error handling and notification system for API responses
- [ ] T016 Create form validation utilities using Zod or similar schema validation
- [ ] T017 Set up authentication guard components for protected routes
- [ ] T018 [P] Create utility functions for date formatting and common operations
- [ ] T019 Create Button component with variants (primary, secondary, danger) per design system
- [ ] T020 Create Input component with validation states matching openapi.yaml schemas
- [ ] T021 Create Card component for grouping related content

## Phase 3: Form Components & Core Todo Management (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable users to manage their personal todo tasks through a web application with proper authentication and data isolation.

**Independent Test**: Users can create an account, log in, create tasks, mark them as complete/incomplete, and delete them - all data remains isolated to their account.

**All {userId} values used in API paths MUST be derived from authenticated user context returned by GET /users/me.**

- [ ] T035 Create FormField component with proper label, input, and error message integration
- [ ] T036 [P] Create FormValidation component with schema validation matching openapi.yaml
- [ ] T037 Create LoginForm component mapping to POST /auth/login from openapi.yaml
- [ ] T038 Create RegisterForm component mapping to POST /auth/register from openapi.yaml
- [ ] T039 Create TaskForm component mapping to POST/PUT /users/{userId}/tasks from openapi.yaml
- [ ] T040 Create TaskFilter component for filtering task lists
- [ ] T041 Create TaskListPage component that fetches data from GET /users/{userId}/tasks
- [ ] T042 Create TaskItem component displaying task data from GET /users/{userId}/tasks response
- [ ] T043 Create TaskItemActions component with buttons for edit/delete/completion
- [ ] T044 Create TaskCompletionToggle component calling PATCH /users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}/complete
- [ ] T045 Create TaskCreationSection component containing TaskForm
- [ ] T046 Create TaskDetailModal component for viewing/editing single tasks
- [ ] T047 Create TaskStats component showing completion metrics
- [ ] T048 Create ProtectedRoute component ensuring authentication before rendering task pages

---

## Phase 4: Authentication Components & User Management (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Authenticated users can interact with the todo system through standardized REST endpoints that enforce user ownership.

**Independent Test**: API endpoints accept valid JWT tokens and reject invalid/unauthorized requests while properly isolating user data.

**This phase extends previously implemented authentication infrastructure; it does not reimplement it.**

- [ ] T049 Create LoginPage component with LoginForm integration
- [ ] T050 Create RegisterPage component with RegisterForm integration
- [ ] T051 Create LogoutButton component that calls authentication cleanup
- [ ] T052 Create UserProfile component displaying data from GET /users/me
- [ ] T053 Create AuthProvider component managing JWT token state
- [ ] T054 Create WithAuth HOC or hook for protecting components requiring authentication
- [ ] T055 Create SessionTimeout component handling JWT expiration

---

## Phase 5: Page Components & Contract Compliance (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: A responsive web interface consumes backend contracts exactly as defined without introducing unauthorized behavior.

**Independent Test**: Frontend makes only documented API calls and properly handles both success and error responses.

**Any frontend behavior not explicitly allowed by openapi.yaml is considered a defect.**
